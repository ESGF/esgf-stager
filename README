The Stager provides the means to transparently cache directory structures 
located at a remote system into a local one. Remote files are cached locally 
preserving the directory structure from the remote system.

This allows the stager to work transparently in many scenarios.


Servlets

A provided implementation uses a Java web Filter for intercepting the file 
requests targeted at servlets running locally. This calls are handled 
differently depending on the user-agent attribute from the http request header.
If the request was started from within a browser, the user will be sent some
kind of feedback to let him/her know the procedure was triggered, e.g. by 
redirecting him to a "waiting page" from where he/she will be automatically 
redirected to the original servlet when the file is retrieved.
In case the request was started by a tool, the request will just block until 
the file is available.
This differential procedure covers both kind of users' expectations.  

The file retrieval will be triggered only once and if the file is already found 
in the cache, the filter will let the request through without delay. 
This call will be still logged to optimize the cache-cleaning mechanism.
